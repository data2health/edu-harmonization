# Research Design
Facilitating discovery of educational resources across the CTSA program as well as externally by supporting community metadata standards and ontologies, harmonizing existing resources, helping to populate community efforts (CLIC EDU warehouse, DIAMOND, N-Lighten etc) by leveraging CD2H metadata and search tools. 

# Methodology
Working with CD2H team members, we will draft an initial proposal for minimal information about educational resources (MIAER) to facilitate metadata annotation for new resources and be responsive to need for "light-weight" curation by community members from key EDU efforts (CLIC, DIAMOND, N-Lighten team). This will be vetted by other NCATS EDU communities and the hubs. These groups will also help prioritize additional resources for automated harvesting/curation and population into NCATS community EDU efforts. 

Community feedback and evaluation will also help improve the underlying resource ontology. Non-traditional EDU resources and use cases currently not covered that are discovered from community evaluation will assist requirements for extensions of metadata/ontology. These requirements will be iteratively incorporated into the CD2H intake/search tools to support population, curation and search for NCATS EDU efforts. 


# Expected Outcomes

An NCATS community vetted metadata standard for the Minimal Information About Educational Resources (both as a white paper and incorporated as requirements into curation/search)

Community feedback to improve the underlying resource ontology

Deployment of expanded CTSA EDU resources in the CD2H faceted search engine

* 1/1 - MIAER community white paper

# Potential Pitfalls and Alternative Strategies
A substantial number of external sources are already being regularly harvested and integrated (DIAMOND, N-Lighten, BD2K GitHub repositories) which significantly reduces the overall risk. The key challenge is successful harmonization of educational resources and agreement on simplifying the current diversity of their descriptions. This will depend on community development of and agreement to MIAER. We believe that this effort being co-led by CLIC EDU, DIAMOND and N-Lighten teams will dramatically reduce risk and we plan for continual feedback and evaluation from the community (in addition to the 2 major evaluation milestones).
