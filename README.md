# educational landscape project

## Problem statement
Educational resources are difficult to find and  utilize in the context of research, trial planning, and precision education. This project aims to reveal the landscape of existing resources and platforms, understand requirements for searching and using them, and make recommendations for a CTSA-wide strategic plan for CTSA training and educational resource discovery. 


## Project description
There is outstanding expertise in mentoring and domain-specific training across the CTSA consortium. Enhancing the discoverability and dissemination of the associated educational and training materials developed across the CTSA will have an immediate impact on the career development and workforce training capability. NCATS has already invested in N-Lighten, a federated platform for education resource sharing. Collaborating with the N-Lighten team, CD2H will support improving discoverability, metadata/ontology curation and enhancing content. This will also allow coordination with other NCATS efforts, like the Development, Implementation and AssessMent of Novel Training in Domain-based Competencies (DIAMOND) which offers a personalized pathway for training in clinical research. Targeted population of N-Lighten with exemplar materials from the CTSAs will provide immediate value and use. We will also work closely the CTSAs and associated working groups on identifying and prioritizing other personalized pathways to this resource.


## Contact person

We require a contact person for each project for administrative purposes. Each project should also have a CD2H Program director assigned.
